| 26.05.2023 	| Today i changed my apps design little bit and categorized the  calculators into 3 categories.  Body Measurement Calculators , Dietary Calculators , Fitness Calculators. For now i am planning to release app with 9 calculators , so every category  will have 3 calculators.  Then maybe later i can add calculators and categories with updates. Currently i have done 6 calculators and there is 3 left.                                                                                                                     	|

| 18.06.2023 	| App logo is chaned for third time and this was the last revision. Folder Structre fixed. Learning about SOLID principles and i am trying to use them on my project as much as i can  and the first principle is single resposibility. in the old version of my code the  calculator function was doing every thing starting from chechking the user inputs to  calculation to reaction. but today i made the changes and after now every event has its own function such as  = verification - calculation - reaction - animation 	|
