This is my first app , an fitness calculators app that calculates sorts of things related with fitness and health. 
i started developing this app a week ago. and for now it has 1 screen for each calculator , also there is going to be a calendar that user can schedule their workout plans.
there is a lot of things to add but i want to keep it simple cause its my first app and i dont want to overdo it.
I do all the design buttons and stuff using figma.

It's been a while since my last update but i have come back another ideas.

26.05.2023 Today i changed my apps design little bit and categorized the calculators into 3 categories.
Body Measurement Calculators , Dietary Calculators , Fitness Calculators.
