This is my first app , an fitness calculators app that calculates sorts of things related with fitness and health. 
i started developing this app a week ago. and for now it has 1 screen for each calculator , also there is going to be a calendar that user can schedule their workout plans.
there is a lot of things to add but i want to keep it simple cause its my first app and i dont want to overdo it.
I do all the design buttons and stuff using figma.

09.05.2023 Today i added the Calorie Intake Calculator

It's been a while since my last update but i have come back another ideas.

26.05.2023 Today i changed my apps design little bit and categorized the calculators into 3 categories.
Body Measurement Calculators , Dietary Calculators , Fitness Calculators.
For now i am planning to release app with 9 calculators , so every category will have 3 calculators. Then maybe later i can add calculators and categories with updates.
Currently i have done 6 calculators and there is 3 left.
